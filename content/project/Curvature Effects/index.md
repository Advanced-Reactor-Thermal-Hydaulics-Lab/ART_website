When fluid moves through curved sections, such as 90- or 180-degree bends, the centrifugal forces and changes in flow dynamics can significantly impact phase distribution, pressure drop, void fraction, and heat transfer efficiency.

ART has established a separate effects test facility to study both the effects of inclination on two-phase flows, as well as the effects of pipe bend curvature.

Experiments are performed with a variety of state-of-the-art instrumentation, including high-speed video camera, an impedance meter, local four-sensor conductivity probes, and gamma densitometry.
