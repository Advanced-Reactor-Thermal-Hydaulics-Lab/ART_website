Seungjin Kim, the Capt. James F. McCarthy, Jr. and Cheryl E. McCarthy Head of the School of Nuclear Engineering, has been appointed to the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Nuclear Energy Advisory Committee (NEAC).

In this new role, Kim will meet biannually with the 25 other committee members to advise the Secretary and the Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy on a number of issues. Items discussed include matters of national policy and scientific aspects of nuclear issues of concern to DOE, periodic reviews of the various program elements within DOE’s nuclear programs and recommendations based thereon, and the needs, views, and priorities of stakeholders of DOE’s nuclear programs.

"I am honored to be invited to assist the DOE’s Office of Nuclear Energy in shaping nation’s nuclear energy program," Kim said. "It's an exciting time to be nuclear engineers with new opportunities for both existing and new nuclear applications, and I am thrilled to be part of DOE’s initiatives and being at the forefront in assisting these efforts."

The NEAC was established in 1998 and includes individuals from academia, industry, and national laboratories.
