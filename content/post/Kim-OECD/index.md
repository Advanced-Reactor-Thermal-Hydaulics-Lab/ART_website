The Global Panel of Universities on Nuclear Energy Technology, Policy and Education, will commence July 24-25, 2019, in Paris, France, where 16 elite universities from NEA’s member countries are invited to attend. Purdue will be represented by Seungjin Kim, the Capt. James McCarthy Jr. and Cheryl E. McCarthy Head of the School of Nuclear Engineering, and Lefteri Tsoukalas, professor of Nuclear Engineering.

“When I saw the invitation letter, I was elated. This is a great honor,” said Kim. “Personally, I’m humbled and feel a great responsibility.”

NEA is an international organization consisting of 33 countries in Europe, the Americas, and the Asia-Pacific regions. Its mission is to provide safe, environmentally sound, and economical use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.

In its invitation letter, NEA explained that Purdue was chosen “because of your university’s record of excellence in nuclear engineering studies.”

This is a unique initiative in which the NEA will seek the advice and views of elite academic institutions to address the complex issues faced by global governments.

“The world has entered a critical period that may determine the future of energy,” writes William D. Magwood, IV, the director-general of the OECD/NEA in his invitation letter.

“There is a growing recognition around the world that nuclear energy can play an important role in future, low-carbon energy systems, but also that long-term, creative thinking is needed to address today’s challenges.”

“We have in-depth technical expertise and infrastructures, with which we can provide advice to the NEA to address all future issues of nuclear energy,” said Kim, referring to the invited universities. “We need to address climate change, how nuclear energy technology can be sustainable for the future of humanity, and how we can provide the world with a clean, safe and resilient energy source.”

Kim said Purdue’s invitation makes perfect sense.

“Purdue Nuclear Engineering has been recognized for its nuclear power engineering and has been a leader from the get-go in the development of nuclear power.

“With its state-of-the-art research and educational infrastructures, Purdue is in a great position to provide a roadmap for the NEA and the rest of the countries in the world,” Kim said. “This invitation is yet another testimony that Purdue Engineering is at the Pinnacle of Excellence.”

**Purdue’s planned contributions to the Global Panel**

Prior to the July meeting, all university participants were asked to present recommendations for items to be explored by the Global Panel of Universities on Nuclear Energy Technology, Policy and Education.

Seungjin Kim, Lefteri Tsoukalas, and CoE Dean Mung Chiang collaborated and submitted the following discussion items:

- Human Capital Development: Educating Future Nuclear Engineers via Online Platforms
- Data Analytics and Big Data, including Nuclear Security
- Scientific Facilities Sharing
- Nuclear as Sustainable Energy
