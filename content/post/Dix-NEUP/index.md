Adam Dix, an undergraduate student in the School of Nuclear Engineering at Purdue University, has been awarded a Nuclear Energy University Program (NEUP) Fellowship from the the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).The fellowship is awarded to students pursuing nuclear energy-related disciplines at universities across the country. Through this program the recipient will receive up to $50,000 a year over the next three years to help pay for their graduate studies and research, plus $5,000 toward a summer internship at a U.S. national laboratory or other approved facility to strengthen the ties between students and the Department’s nuclear energy research programs. The student will study a breadth of critical nuclear energy issues, from fuel cycle sustainability to reactor efficiency and design. 

Adam will be receiving his bachelors in Nuclear Engineering from Purdue University May 2020. “Adam is excited to get his PhD at Purdue working on the Versatile Test Reactor, through the generous support of the DOE’ Integrated University Partnership program.” Adam’s future plans once he receives his PhD is to work at a national laboratory on liquid metal thermal-hydraulics and fast reactor safety, with an eye towards helping licenses and encouraging their widespread adoption.
