ART has been selected to fulfill the US Department of Energy's strategic needs blue sky project, studying the fundamental hydrodynamics of two-phase flow under the geometric effects of pipe orientation and U-bends. 

Most two-phase flow analyses have been performed in straight vertical-upward pipes. However, nuclear reactor systems include piping with different geometric components, such as elbows or U-bends, as well as changes in flow orientations. The project will perform experiments in a scaled test facility existing at ART to investigate the effects of flow orientations and geometries relevant to nuclear reactor systems on the hydrodynamics of two-phase flow.
