Drew Ryan, doctoral candidate at the School of Nuclear Engineering (NE), won the Best Movie Award at the 19th International Topical Meeting on Nuclear Reactor Thermal Hydraulics (NURETH 19). The conference took place virtually this year. 

Held every two years in various destinations across North America, Europe and Asia, the meeting is one of the premier gatherings for experts in nuclear reactor thermal hydraulics and related fields

Ryan, along with his co-authors, received the Best Movie Award for his movie titled, “Inclined Two-Phase Flow Experiments.” The award is a welcome accolade for their recent research investigating how flow orientation effects two-phase systems.
