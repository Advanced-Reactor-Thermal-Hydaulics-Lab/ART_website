Alicja Stoppel, a senior at the Purdue University School of Nuclear Engineering, recently participated in the 2024 cohort of the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) Global Forum Rising Stars Workshop in Nuclear Education, Science, Technology, and Policy.

The Global Forum Rising Stars Program welcomes emerging female leaders in science, technology, education, and policy into the global nuclear community. Through its annual workshop and additional activities, the program offers professional development, mentorship, and peer networking opportunities for women in nuclear and related fields, helping them build successful careers and forge lasting professional connections.

This year’s event took place on November 25-26 at the European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC) in Karlsruhe, Germany. The forum featured keynote speakers, panel discussions, and valuable networking opportunities. Stoppel presented her research with a poster presentation titled, "Understanding the Effect of Geometry on Two-phase Flow in Advancing Nuclear Technology," and received a certificate of completion. She connected with fellow participants from across the global nuclear field as the program welcomed rising stars in science, technology, education, and policy.

“I am extremely honored to have been nominated and selected as a Rising Star,” Stoppel shared. “This was an amazing opportunity to network with industry leaders and peers, and to learn more about the cutting-edge work happening in the nuclear field. I was particularly excited to hear from other Rising Stars and contribute to the advancement of the field.”
