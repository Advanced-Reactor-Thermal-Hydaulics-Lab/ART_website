Dr. Kim, an ANS Fellow and member since 1997, was selected in recognition of his "outstanding contribution towards advancing two-phase flow experimental capabilities, fundamental understanding of two-phase flow transport phenomena and reactor thermal-hydraulic analysis.”

Dr. Kim was presented the award at the ANS Winter Conference and Expo in Washington, D.C. “This award is considered the highest honor in the field of reactor thermal-hydraulics, and I am honored to be recognized,” Kim said. “Considering that I am the fourth faculty in our School to receive this award, it is also a testimony to the quality of our department and faculty.”

Congratulations to Dr. Kim for this prestigious award!
