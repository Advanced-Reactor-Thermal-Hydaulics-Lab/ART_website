Dr. Seungjin Kim, the Capt. James F. McCARTy Jr. and Cheryl E. McCARTy Head and Professor of Nuclear Engineering and Director of ART, has been named a Principal in Charge of the Purdue University - Duke Energy nuclear power exploratory study.

In [April 2022](https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2022/Q2/purdue-and-duke-energy-to-explore-potential-for-clean,-nuclear-power-source-for-campus.html), Purdue University and Duke Energy announced their plan to jointly explore the feasability of using advanced small modular nuclear reactors for the energy needs of the Purdue West Lafayette Campus.

Along with Dr. Seungjin Kim, two other Principals in Charge were named to ensure the success of the exploratory study: Michael B. Cline, the senior vice-president of Purdue administrative operations and Chris Nolan, the vice president of new nuclear generation of Duke Energy.
