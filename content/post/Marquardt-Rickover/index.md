Jeremy Marquardt, an undergraduate student in the School of Nuclear Engineering at Purdue University and an undergraduate member of TRSL, has been awarded a Rickover Fellowship from the Naval Reactors Division of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). This opportunity is considered as one of the most prestigious fellowships in the nation, awarded to top students pursuing a Ph.D. degree in nuclear engineering.

The four-year fellowship is intended to provide education on the maintenance and development of science and engineering technology pertaining to naval nuclear propulsion and advancing fission energy development.

Jeremy is receiving his bachelors in Nuclear Engineering from Purdue in May 2020. After graduation he is planning to join Dr. Chatzidakis to develop a nuclear engineering research group at Purdue with a focus on AI and machine learning applications to nucelar reactor control.
