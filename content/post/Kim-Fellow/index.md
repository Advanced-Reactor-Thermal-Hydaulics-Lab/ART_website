Seungjin Kim, the Capt. James F. McCarthy Jr. & Cheryl E. McCarthy Head of the School of Nuclear Engineering, has been elected to American Nuclear Society Fellow Grade, the highest membership grade of the ANS. The society has a membership of around 11,000 professionals.

Kim will be among seven others to receive this elite honor during the Opening Plenary of the ANS Winter Meeting on Oct. 30 in Washington D.C. His framed certificate will read: “Dr. Kim has made contributions toward advancing reactor thermal-hydraulic analysis methods by developing dynamic two-phase flow models, developing advanced instrumentation that expanded capability of two-phase flow experiments, educating nuclear engineers in academics, and providing services to ANS through various leadership positions in the Thermal-Hydraulic Division and in professional meetings.”

Kim (MS ’92 EE, Ph.D ’99 NE) joined Purdue as head of NE in June 2017. He also holds a master’s degree in physics from South Dakota State University and a bachelor’s degree in physics from Sogang University, Seoul, Korea. He served as chair of the ANS Thermal Hydraulics Division (THD) in 2016-17 and previously as vice chair, secretary, and treasurer.

Kim said he is humbled by the recognition. “This is the most important professional society for nuclear engineers in all areas of expertise,” he said, adding, “While I am delighted by this honor, I feel a greater responsibility as a member of the nuclear engineering community, as an educator and as a researcher.”

Kim also is a member of the American Society of Mechanical Engineering (ASME), Sigma Pi Sigma, Korea Nuclear Society (KNS), and Korean-American Scientist and Engineers Association (KSEA).
