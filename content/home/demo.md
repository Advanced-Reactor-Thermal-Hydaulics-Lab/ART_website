Welcome to the Advanced Reactor Thermal-hydraulics (ART) Laboratory at Purdue University. We perform research in the area of nuclear reactor thermal-hydraulics and two-phase flow. More specifically, we design and perform scaled experiments, model multiphase flow phenomena, develop advanced two-phase flow instrumentation, and apply computational methods for multiphase analysis. Some of the research topics of interest include: Two-phase flow analysis and interfacial area transport models in various orientations, restrictions, and sizes, nuclear reactor safety analysis, advanced flow instrumentation, reactor systems analysis codes, liquid metal reactors, gas-cooled reactors, and CFD analysis.

**Interested students are encouraged to contact Dr. Seungjin Kim (seungjin@purdue.edu) for addtional information.**
