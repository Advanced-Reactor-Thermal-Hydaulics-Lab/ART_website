Flow regimes are widely implemented in thermal-hydraulics and reactor safety simulation tools. It is therefore crucial to properly classify flow conditions into their respective regimes to design and operate multiphase flow systems. The traditional approach to flow regime classification entails recording two-phase flows in transparent pipes with high-speed video cameras and making subjective judgements about the flow based on visualization. This subjectivity is susceptible to error and disagreement between researchers. Additionally, pipe inclination introduces additional complexity that makes visual classification of flow regimes challenging. Recent work with machine learning has endeavored to reduce the subjectivity involved in flow regime identification and classification efforts.\nART has developed a modular structure of k-means algorithms designed to objectively organize horizontal, inclined, and vertical flow conditions into flow regimes using an experimental database obtained with the separate effects test facility.\n Flow chart of the hierarchical structure (B: Bubbly, P: Plug, ST: Stratified, S: Slug, CT: Churn-Turbulent, SW: Stratified-Wavy, A: Annular)   Images of flow conditions at different angles are shown in Figure 2, highlighting the changes to the interfacial structure that can occur with respect to angle.\n Hierarchical algorithm two-phase flow regime map results: (a) 90° upward, (b) 80° upward, (c) 60° upward, (d) 30° upward, (e) 0° compared to visualization   ","date":1653609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653609600,"objectID":"5d155dae455e09de97971fb0cdc905ca","permalink":"https://engineering.purdue.edu/ARTH/project/inclined-flow-regime-identification/","publishdate":"2022-05-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/ARTH/project/inclined-flow-regime-identification/","section":"project","summary":"Experiments and machine learning applications for flow regime identification","tags":["Active","Two-phase flow","Experiments","Flow Regime Transition","Machine Learning"],"title":"Objective Flow Regime Identification for Inclined Two-Phase Flows","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":["News"],"content":"Zhengting Quan (Front Row, Far Left), a Ph.D. student in ART, has been inducted into Alpha Nu Sigma, the nuclear engineering honor society.\nAlpha Nu Sigma was founded by the American Nuclear Society in 1979 and consists of more than 20 chapters throughout the United States.

Bundles with many rods have extensively been studied as representative of large fuel assemblies, however far fewer experiments have investigated 7-pin bundles. The Versatile Test Reactor (VTR) sodium cartridge loop proposes to use a 7-pin bundle as its experimental core region, highlighting the need for additional data and models.\nThis work seeks to establish a better understanding of the pressure drop in 7-pin wire-wrapped rod bundles through scaled experiments and a novel pressure drop model. A scaling analysis is first performed to demonstrate the applicability of water experiments to the VTR sodium cartridge loop, before an experimental test facility is designed and constructed. Experiments are then performed to determine the pressure drop.\nCurrent models are able to predict the data well, but are complex and can be difficult to use. A comparatively simpler model has been developed, based on exact laminar solutions of a simplified rod bundle, which also offers a theoretical lower bound for the pressure drop. The proposed model compares well with the existing experimental database, able to predict bundle friction factor with an average absolute percent difference of 10.8%. This accuracy is also similar to existing correlations.\nFeatured image from \u0026ldquo;The upgraded Cheng and Todreas correlation for pressure drop in hexagonal wire-wrapped rod bundles\u0026rdquo; by S.K.

Recent studies have systematically investigated horizontal two-phase flows, showing the effects of buoyancy acting perpendicular to the flow direction. Varying the angle of inclination can yield different body force effects from either vertical or horizontal, which can affect the void distribution, flow regime transitions, pressure drop, relative motion between gas and liquid phases.\nART has established a separate effects test facility to study both the effects of inclination on two-phase flows, as well as the conventional inverted U steam generator.

In order to develop novel and advanced fuels and materials for advanced reactors, an intense fast neutron environment is needed for testing. However, no fast-reactor-based neutron source is available in U.S. since the shutdown of Fast Flux Test Facility (FFTF) in 1990s. As such, the Versatile Test Reactor (VTR) program is established to accelerate the testing and qualification of the new designs of fuel and materials. In VTR, an internal cartridge loop design with flowing different coolants (e.g., liquid metal, gas, and molten salt) is adopted to provide appropriate in-core environment. This design can isolate the test vehicle coolant loop from the primary reactor coolant to maximize the testing capability.\n A schematic of the VTR cartridge loop   The objective of the present research is to develop a CFD design tool for the cartridge loop in VTR. A scaling analysis is first performed to investigate the feasibility of using water loop to replace sodium loop, while CFD simulation is performed to support scaling analysis and/or to improve the test facility design. Heat transfer experiments will be performed on the constructed test facilities to investigate the overall functionality and performance of the cartridge loop at different boundary conditions. Test conditions may include steady-state parametric studies on flow rates and core power, and transient studies on increasing core power, loss of flow, etc. In the end, the CFD simulation results will be evaluated based on the obtained experimental data and a CFD design tool will be developed.\n","date":1598486400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598486400,"objectID":"dd197009260f1882f705e832427b142c","permalink":"https://engineering.purdue.edu/ARTH/project/versatile-test-reactor/","publishdate":"2020-08-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/ARTH/project/versatile-test-reactor/","section":"project","summary":"Scaling analysis and Computational Fluid Dynamics analysos of the Versatile Test Reactor","tags":["Active","CFD","Scaling"],"title":"Experimental Study and CFD Design Tool Development for the Cartridge Loop in the Versatile Test Reactor (VTR)","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":["News"],"content":"Dr. Ran Kong, ART Alum and Postdoctoral Researcher, is featured in an episode of the [Purdue Engineering Podcast].\nDr. Kong’s original intention was to study coal power plants during his undergraduate studies in China, yet after taking an “intro to nuclear energy” course, he learned of the importance of carbon-free emissions to the planet’s future. The nuclear industry’s reliability, emphasis on safety, and sustainability drew Dr. Kong to study nuclear engineering as a way to steer the world away from the toxicity of carbon emitters.\nDr. Kong works at the Advanced Reactor Thermal-Hydraulics (ART) Laboratory at Purdue with the goal of design improvements for high-performing reactor systems.

Fast neutron fluxes greater than 1015 n/cm2s are required for radiation damage studies with significant displacements per atom (DPA), which are conventionally achieved with fast reactors. However, since the shutdown of the Fast Flux Test Facility (FFTF), the United States (U.S.) has not had a fast-reactor-based neutron source. To address this issue, Niowave, Inc. proposes to develop a HYbrid fast/thermal core configuration Subcritical Testbed (HYST) to provide a testing capability for novel designs of fuels and materials in a fast reactor like environment. The fast core region of the testbed is cooled by liquid LBE and can provide a sufficient volume for testing advanced nuclear reactor materials in a liquid metal environment. Considering that the proposed subcritical testbed facility is not a reactor, it will be cheaper and faster to license that a reactor. In order for HYST to be realized, however, the thermal-hydraulic analysis of the designed systems needs to be performed using experimental data.\nIn the current work, Purdue will assist Niowave, Inc. in test facility design and data analysis. This includes providing design considerations such as test loop components and setup, implementing various instruments and assisting Niowave, Inc. in developing plans for experiments such as test procedures, test conditions, and test plans.

Many two-phase flow experiments have been performed in vertical two-phase flow. However, there has been little investigation of horizontal flows compared with vertical flows. The highly asymmetric void distribution in horizontal flow, which is due to the effect of the buoyancy force, adds more difficulties to both experimental and analytical studies. As such, previous work on vertical flow cannot be directly extended to horizontal flow.\nAlthough there have been research to investigate horizontal two-phase flow through experiments, database required for accurate model development in horizontal two-phase flow is still limited. Furthermore, most of the previous work focusing on investigation of dispersed bubbly flow in small diameter pipes (10 mm to 50 mm). As such, systematic investigation on scalability of the experimental data and closure relations developed in small diameter pipes is indispensable for large diameter horizontal two-phase flow analysis. The highly asymmetric distribution of the dispersed phase in horizontal two-phase flow makes the scalability study more important compared to vertical two-phase flow, because the ratio of characteristic bubble length scale to pipe diameter may govern the severity of the asymmetry in bubble distribution and the flow transition criteria.\nThe present work establishes a 4-in I.D. horizontal, adiabatic, two-phase flow test facility to: (1) perform detailed flow visualizations; (2) investigate the interfacial structures and flow regime transition criteria; (3) establish an extensive database in bubbly, plug and slug flow regimes in relation to future transition criteria modeling efforts; (4) investigate the scalability of the flow regime transition criteria in horizontal two-phase flow.\nThe test facility is designed to be capable of performing experiments in a comprehensive range of horizontal two-phase flow conditions including bubbly, plug, slug, stratified, stratified-wavy, and annular flow regimes.

Experimental studies are crucial in improving the understanding of the effect of flow restrictions on two-phase flow and developing dynamic models for transport of interfacial area.\n A simple schematic of the combinatorial two-phase flow facility.   This project is focused on investigating the geometric effects of 90-degree vertical elbows and combinatorial flow configuration on two-phase flow. The experimental facility consists of vertical and horizontal sections made out of 50.8 mm inner diameter acrylic pipes interconnected via 90-degree vertical glass elbows. The maximum development length in the vertical and horizontal section is 66D and 180D respectively. A total of 24 measurement locations are present along the test section. A set of two injectors and manipulating valves allows the two-phase flow to be started in either vertical-upward or vertical-downward flow configurations. This flow loop is capable of simulating different flow configurations such as co-current or countercurrent flow.\nA high speed camera is employed to perform flow visualization studies across the first 90-degree vertical elbow. Based on extensive flow visualization studies modified horizontal two-phase flow regime maps are suggested at two locations downstream of the vertical elbow as shown in Figure 2.\n Modified flow regime maps for horizontal two-phase flow downstream of the vertical elbow (Conventional map by Mandhane (1974)).

Interesting results are obtained in the horizontal section immediately downstream of the vertical elbow wherein the local void fraction has a dual peaked profile along the horizontal axis of the pipe cross-section.

Many geometric effects of two-phase flow encountered in a typical reactor system have not yet been fully examined, including the effect of rod bundle spacer grids.\nThe purpose of this research is to investigate the geometric effects of two- phase flow through a prototypic spacer grid to establish both the local and global database necessary for model development and code validation. The end goal is to develop predictive models that account for the effects of spacer grids and to serve as constitutive relations in the interfacial area transport equation. This model has been developed for various flow conditions and has been validated in an extensive database; however, further study on geometric effects is indispensable to establish a comprehensive and robust model. In view of this, the present test facility is designed to study the effects of rod bundle spacer grids on interfacial area transport in two-phase flow.\nThe facility employed is a scaled test facility based on a conventional pressurized water reactor. 19 dimensionless geometric parameters and five flow parameters were employed in the design of the facility to achieve similarity between the test facility and the prototypic system. The facility consists of a 1x3 array of 3.18 cm diameter simulant fuel rods with a pitch of 4.45 cm that are arranged in a rectangular channel with a 13.65 cm x 4.45 cm cross-section that spans 3.3 m from injection to outlet. The facility was designed as a narrow rectangular channel with clear acrylic sides and rods to facilitate flow visualization. Seven axial measurement locations are available along the length of the test section, one upstream of the spacer grid and six downstream of the spacer grid, to obtain measurements of local two-phase flow parameters throughout the channel cross-section\n Spacer-grid separate-effects two-phase flow test facility   A High speed camera is employed to perform flow visualizations to visually observe the effect of the spacer grid on flow regime transition. Four flow regimes are observed by researchers: Bubbly, Cap-Turbulent, Slug and Churn-Turbulent. Two major effects of the spacer grid on the flow regime transition are observed, bubble coalescence, and bubble breakup. The observation of larger bubbles after the spacer grid indicated bubble coalescence for various conditions. While during other conditions the increased quantity of smaller bubbles indicated bubble breakup occurring.\n Spacer-grid separate-effects two-phase flow test facility schematic.

Many two-phase flow experiments have been performed in vertical flow channel geometries, and thus a substantial number of databases exist to benchmark MCFD approaches in such conditions. However, there are few databases of local two-phase flow parameters acquired in straight horizontal flow channels available that are suitable for comparisons with MCFD and the development of multi-phase closure models. The present work establishes a horizontal, adiabatic, air-water, two-phase flow test facility to: (1) perform detailed flow visualizations, (2) study the interfacial structures and flow regime transitions, and (3) identify gas-phase interactions in air-water horizontal two-phase flow in relation to future interfacial area transport modeling efforts. Figures 1 and 2 highlight two of the bubble interaction mechanisms: turbulence impact breakup and random collision coalescence.\nThe test facility is designed to be capable of performing experiments in a comprehensive range of horizontal two-phase flow conditions including bubbly, plug, slug, stratified, stratified-wavy, and annular flow regimes. The test section is desiged to provide an ideal condition for flow visualization and for the application of optical instrumentation. A high speed movie camera capable of capturing images at up to 32,000 frames per second is available and will be employed to perform flow visualization studies. In order to achieve a fully developed horizontal two-phase flow, clear acrylic pipes with 3.81 cm inner diameter are employed as the test section, which provide a total development length of more than 200 diameters.\n Time series of bubble breakup by turbulence impact process. jf=5.00 m/s, jg,atm=0.05 m/s at a development length of 80 diameters.   The purpose of the first portion of this research is to perform a scoping experiment to study the effects of break angle and break length-to-diameter ratio (L/D) on the exchange rate during the postulated scenario. Here, water and brine are used as simulant fluids, and flow visualization and density measurement experiments have been performed. The exchange rate is expressed in terms of a non-dimensional Froude number which scales the inertia with respect to the buoyancy. The results obtained are compared with previous studies as shown below.\n Time series of bubble coalescence by random collision process. jf=5.00 m/s, jg,atm=0.10 m/s at a development length of 80 diameters.

Accurately modeling this event is necessary for licensing the VHTR and currently no adequate experimental database exists to create or validate models for predicting D-LOFC behavior. In particular, the ingress of air into the reactor vessel which can oxidize the graphite structures.\n Flow exchange visualization in horizontal and vertical breaks   The purpose of the first portion of this research is to perform a scoping experiment to study the effects of break angle and break length-to-diameter ratio (L/D) on the exchange rate during the postulated scenario. Here, water and brine are used as simulant fluids, and flow visualization and density measurement experiments have been performed. The exchange rate is expressed in terms of a non-dimensional Froude number which scales the inertia with respect to the buoyancy. The results obtained are compared with previous studies as shown below.\n Comparison of proposed correlation to experimental data    Comparison of average Froude number for linear region with previous studies   The purpose of the second portion of this research is to determine the time available for mitigative actions before the onset of natural circulation where the graphite oxidation increases. The buoyancy-driven exchange stage of the air ingress phenomena will be simulated using a scaled VHTR vessel and the effect of break orientation (angle) and development length to break size (L/D) will be investigated.\n","date":1282867200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1282867200,"objectID":"b6fef89fa13c0ed1a621e0d6d3d155c2","permalink":"https://engineering.purdue.edu/ARTH/project/air-ingress-vhtr/","publishdate":"2010-08-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/ARTH/project/air-ingress-vhtr/","section":"project","summary":"Investigations on the postualated Depressurized Loss of Forced Circulation event for the Very High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactors (VHTR).","tags":["Previous","Experiments","VHTR"],"title":"Air-Ingress in VHTR","type":"project"},{"authors":["Suchismita Sarangi","Justin Talley","Rachael Sakurai","Jenna Baird","J.P Spring","Seungjin Kim","A.
