      <title>ART will lead $6 million project to revitalize research infastructure</title>
      <link>https://engineering.purdue.edu/ARTH/post/2024-neup-revitalization/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 26 Jun 2024 16:50:58 +0200</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ART&amp;rsquo;S leadership in nuclear energy technologies research has resulted in a $6 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy to lead a consortium that will revitalize nuclear research facilities and expand university-led research for small modular reactor (SMR) and advanced reactor (AR) technologies. The group consists of five universities and colleges and two national labs, which will work to upgrade research facilities, increase their capabilities and develop programs to educate the future nuclear energy workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ART’s Seungjin Kim, the Capt. James F. McCarthy, Jr. and Cheryl E. McCarthy Head of the School of Nuclear Engineering, will lead the collaborative work with Massachusetts Institute of Technology and North Carolina State University. The project’s goal is to revitalize four existing nuclear reactor research facilities and expand research and educational programs, including developing nuclear curricula with Ivy Tech for training skilled trades, as well as programs for underrepresented groups with the Tougaloo College Research and Development Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project will establish new cyber-physical capabilities that enable a wide range of SMR and AR technologies. It will establish a user facility composed of four interconnected cyber-physical facilities equipped with state-of-the-art digital instrumentation and control systems, which will serve as a regional center of excellence for research, education and training. The center will promote sharing equipment and instrumentation by universities, national labs, industry partners and other institutions for multidisciplinary research and demonstration. Infrastructure design and development also will be guided and supported by Argonne National Laboratory, Idaho National Laboratory, as well as eight major nuclear industry partners who will facilitate internship and apprenticeship opportunities for students. They are BWX Technologies Inc., Constellation Energy Corp., Curtiss-Wright Corp., Duke Energy Corp., GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, Oak Ridge Associated Universities, Sargent &amp;amp; Lundy and Westinghouse Electric Co. Purdue will lead the consortium consisting of five academic institutions and two national labs, supported by eight major nuclear industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim said the grant from the DOE’s Office of Nuclear Energy reflects Purdue’s tradition of excellence in the nuclear energy field: “These programs will enable synergetic cooperation between educational institutions, national labs, the nuclear industry and policymakers, and help build a sustainable platform for advanced nuclear technology research innovation and the future nuclear workforce.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim is enthusiastic about the potential of all the latest reactor technologies, including SMRs and ARs, which he says improve on their larger reactor counterparts by being “more robust in construction and installation, more flexible in siting, equipped with advanced design features including enhanced safety systems, and dispatchable,” among other attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the exciting things about SMR and AR technologies is that they allow for load-following and hybrid with other renewables like solar and wind,” Kim said. “You can also generate hydrogen without any carbon generation. Additionally, by being smaller and flexible, the electricity generated by SMR and AR can be used toward charging electric vehicles, for example. Nuclear energy can actually be used to create a 100% carbon-free energy ecosystem that would not be possible without it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work supported by the DOE grant will upgrade Purdue’s multidimensional integral test assembly, known as PUMA, which is the only existing scaled integral test facility for advanced light-water reactor designs. PUMA will be refurbished and given new capabilities, including its digital-twin system with a full-scale reactor control room. It will also upgrade Purdue’s existing research reactor (PUR-1), which is the first and only university reactor licensed by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a fully digitized instrument and control system. PUR-1 will be enhanced with a high-fidelity, real-time digital twin with two-way TCP/IP (transmission control protocol/internet protocol) communications. The digital replica of the physical reactor systems will facilitate simulations and analyses to further enhance research toward SMR and AR technologies. In addition, complementary upgrades are planned at MIT and N.C. State, enabling the sharing of unique equipment and instrumentation for studies of advanced nuclear technology concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When established, Kim said, the new and upgraded infrastructure will provide the broader nuclear engineering community with a test bed for cyber-physical research to develop and demonstrate new and potentially revolutionary technologies that include quantum-based cybersecurity, semiautonomous control and remote or unattended operation, digital twinning, diagnostics, and prognostics and sensor placement, among many others related to SMR and AR technology development.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ART studies SMRs for the Indiana Office of Energy Development (IOED)</title>
      <link>https://engineering.purdue.edu/ARTH/post/ioed/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 16:50:58 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://engineering.purdue.edu/ARTH/post/ioed/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Purdue University has been selected by the Indiana Office of Energy Development (IOED) to research small modular nuclear reactor (SMR) technology and analyze the potential impacts should the technology be deployed in Indiana. This partnership comes following Purdue’s selection as the successful respondent to IOED’s Request for Proposals for an Indiana-focused SMR study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The energy transition is ongoing and will be for decades to come. In Indiana, we’ve added a lot of tools to our toolbox to help better manage the energy transition, but the conversations must continue,” said Ryan Hadley, executive director, Indiana Office of Energy Development. “This SMR study is reflective of a proactive spirit to learn more about Indiana’s possible energy future. We are eager to learn more from this opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SMR study aligns with the IOED’s mission to provide comprehensive energy planning and policy development for Indiana that is affordable, stable, reliable and inclusive of a diverse and balanced generation mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As a state and national leader in nuclear engineering education and research, along with our proven track record in innovation and energy generation, we are uniquely positioned to work with the Office of Energy Development on this exciting endeavor,” said Dr. Seungjin Kim, the Capt. James F. McCarthy, Jr. and Cheryl E. McCarthy Head of the School of Nuclear Engineering at Purdue University, who is leading the study as the principal investigator (PI). “We carefully assembled a project team that consists of experts from Purdue University as well as Argonne National Laboratory, Energy Systems Network and Ivy Tech Community College.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assembled team, in coordination with the IOED, will perform an extensive study on topics related to SMR technology:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current status of SMR technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;State and local economic impact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workforce development and employment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Safety, environmental impact and nuclear waste, siting considerations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Community engagement needs and best practices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest in SMR technology in Indiana has grown in recent years. The Indiana General Assembly has passed legislation related to SMR technology development (IC 8-1-8.5-12.1), and Purdue and Duke Energy published an interim report related to their ongoing study investigating the feasibility of using advanced nuclear energy to meet the West Lafayette campus community’s long-term energy needs. Through collaboration with some of the leading experts in advanced nuclear technology in both the public and private sector, Purdue and Duke Energy identified a number of findings and recommended next steps in the interim report, which are succinctly summarized in a two-page fact sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Purdue began seriously researching the practical application of small modular nuclear technology with Duke Energy in 2022 when we kicked off our joint feasibility study,” said Ryan Gallagher, associate vice president of Purdue Facilities Operations and Environmental Health and Safety and a co-PI for the project. “Since then, we have continued to expand our knowledge on topics including technology development, approval and implementation timelines, siting considerations and other factors that position us well to help the state evaluate the potential benefits SMRs could bring to Indiana.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work on the SMR study began earlier this year and will be completed by Oct. 31, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ART has been selected to fulfill the US Department of Energy&amp;rsquo;s strategic needs blue sky project, studying the fundamental hydrodynamics of two-phase flow under the geometric effects of pipe orientation and U-bends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most two-phase flow analyses have been performed in straight vertical-upward pipes. However, nuclear reactor systems include piping with different geometric components, such as elbows or U-bends, as well as changes in flow orientations. The project will perform experiments in a scaled test facility existing at ART to investigate the effects of flow orientations and geometries relevant to nuclear reactor systems on the hydrodynamics of two-phase flow.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dr. Ran Kong Featured on the Purdue Engineering Podcast</title>
      <link>https://engineering.purdue.edu/ARTH/post/kong_podcast/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 26 Aug 2020 16:50:58 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://engineering.purdue.edu/ARTH/post/kong_podcast/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ran Kong, ART Alum and Postdoctoral Researcher, is featured in an episode of the [Purdue Engineering Podcast].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kong’s original intention was to study coal power plants during his undergraduate studies in China, yet after taking an “intro to nuclear energy” course, he learned of the importance of carbon-free emissions to the planet’s future. The nuclear industry’s reliability, emphasis on safety, and sustainability drew Dr. Kong to study nuclear engineering as a way to steer the world away from the toxicity of carbon emitters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kong works at the Advanced Reactor Thermal-Hydraulics (ART) Laboratory at Purdue with the goal of design improvements for high-performing reactor systems. At ART, Kong has the capability to study fluid mechanics, heat and mass transfer, and safety in nuclear systems. His current focus is his work with the Versatile Test Reactor (VTR), a Department of Energy-funded program intended to accelerate and improve generation IV reactor designs. Dr. Kong is collaborating with Argonne National Laboratory and Idaho National Laboratory to design the VTR’s sodium-cooled cartridge loop to assist the development of sodium fast reactors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VTR program contributes directly to the United States’ ability to maintain its leadership in advanced reactor technologies, which was threatened by the shutdown of the Fast Flux Test Facility (FFTF) in the 1990s. The VTR re-establishes the testing capability, allowing for the continuous development of new materials and nuclear fuels for the next generation of reactors. The global market for nuclear power technology is estimated at $1 trillion, nuclear power generation is projected to grow 73% by 2040, and most of the existing reactors are on track to retire within the next few decades. Thus, the contributions of the VTR are crucial if the United States, and even the world, is to keep up with global energy demand in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Global Panel of Universities on Nuclear Energy Technology, Policy and Education, will commence July 24-25, 2019, in Paris, France, where 16 elite universities from NEA’s member countries are invited to attend. Purdue will be represented by Seungjin Kim, the Capt. James McCarthy Jr. and Cheryl E. McCarthy Head of the School of Nuclear Engineering, and Lefteri Tsoukalas, professor of Nuclear Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When I saw the invitation letter, I was elated. This is a great honor,” said Kim. “Personally, I’m humbled and feel a great responsibility.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEA is an international organization consisting of 33 countries in Europe, the Americas, and the Asia-Pacific regions. Its mission is to provide safe, environmentally sound, and economical use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its invitation letter, NEA explained that Purdue was chosen “because of your university’s record of excellence in nuclear engineering studies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a unique initiative in which the NEA will seek the advice and views of elite academic institutions to address the complex issues faced by global governments.&lt;/p&gt;
